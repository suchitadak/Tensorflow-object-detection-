# Tensorflow-object-detection-

Getting computers to recognize objects has been a historically difficult problem in computer science, 
but with the rise of machine learning it is becoming easier to solve. One of the tools that can be put
to work in object recognition is an open source library called TensorFlow, which [Evan] aka [Edje Electronics] has put
to work for exactly this purpose.
  also makes use of Open CV. [Evan] notes that this opens up a lot of creative low-cost detection applications for the Pi, 
 such as setting up a camera that detects when a pet is waiting at the door to be let inside or outside, counting the number
 of bees entering and exiting a beehive, or monitoring parking spaces at an office.This project uses a number of other toolkits 
 as well, including Protobuf. It also makes extensive use of Python scripts
